# Deep-learning-challenge


The purpose of this chllenge is to create a Neural Network Model that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Results
* The target variable for the model was the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column. this column shows whether or not the money was used effectiveley
* The variables that wer features are all the other columns exept for 'EIN' and 'NAME' as they did not add information that would change the outcome
* It might be worth looking into dropping the 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS' column since those are completed on a case by case basis
